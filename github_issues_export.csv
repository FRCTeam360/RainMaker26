This means the command runs indefinitely until interrupted, and the end action is redundant (it just re-commands the same position).  The command should instead run until the position is within tolerance of the setpoint, then end itself.  For the inputs we should add to the relevant subsystems, follow this pattern:     inputs.setPoint = intakePivot.getClosedLoopReference().getValueAsDouble();     inputs.atSetPoint = TOLERANCE > Math.abs(intakePivot.getClosedLoopReference().getValueAsDouble() - intakePivot.getPosition().getValueAsDouble()); ","good first issue","JAMobley","Week 3","Commands"
