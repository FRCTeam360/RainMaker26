11,Implement Snap to Hub Using Localization,Automation feature to automatically align robot to the hub.,Automation
31,Implement FMS API for scoring code,"Integrate with the FMS (Field Management System) API to track scoring events during matches.

Reference the WPILib DriverStation class for FMS communication.",Automation
117,Implement Turret Subsystem,"Create a new turret subsystem following the AdvantageKit IO layer pattern (TurretIO interface, TurretIOSim for simulation, TurretIOWB for WoodBot hardware). The turret should rotate to aim at the hub/scoring target. Include methods for setting angle setpoints, reading encoder position, and controlling the motor. Add turret CAN ID to Constants.WoodBotConstants.",Subsystems
139,Update motor type and motor controller spreadsheet for Practice Bot,"Document all motor types (NEO, Falcon 500, etc.) and their associated motor controllers (SparkMax, TalonFX) for the practice bot hardware. Create or update a spreadsheet that maps each subsystem to its motors, CAN IDs, and controller types. This helps ensure correct hardware configuration when building practice bot IO implementations.",Subsystems
198,Incorporate Hopper Sensors into Middle Auto Command,"Update the middle autonomous routine to use the indexer and intake sensors (defined in Constants.WoodBotConstants as INDEXER_SENSOR_PORT, INTAKE_SENSOR_PORT, etc.) to detect when game pieces are collected. The auto should wait for sensor confirmation before advancing to the next step. This prevents the robot from attempting to shoot without having a game piece.",Automation
103,Port CommandLogger utility from RainMaker25,Port the [CommandLogger utility class](https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker25/blob/main/src/main/java/frc/robot/utils/CommandLogger.java) from RainMaker25 to RainMaker26 for logging command start and end events.,Tooling

Test that turret can rotate to target angles and track hub position.",Simulations
101,Test Superstructure Subsystem in Sim,"Once the Superstructure class is created (replacing CommandFactory), test it in simulation mode. Verify that the superstructure can coordinate multiple subsystems (intake, indexer, flywheel, hood, turret) together for complex actions like shooting. Check that state machines work correctly and subsystems don't interfere with each other. Use AdvantageScope to analyze logged data.",Simulations
14,Set up unit testing,Implement unit testing to check if code outputs desired results.,Tooling
37,Re-implement simple AprilTag targeting,"Implement a command that uses Vision subsystem data to aim the robot (and/or turret) at AprilTags on the field. Use the VisionMeasurement class and Limelight data (from VisionIOLimelight) to calculate the angle to the target. Create a simple PID controller to rotate the robot/turret to face the AprilTag. Reference WPILib's AprilTag documentation and the FIELD_LAYOUT constant.",Vision
46,Test impact of the bump on localization,We're concerned that going over the bump will negatively impact vision localization and the gyro's stability.  We must test if and how much of an issue it is.,Testing
70,Implement simple implementation of override feedback in pathplanner,"Add steer override functionality to PathPlanner autos using the SwerveRequest system. This allows the robot to automatically adjust its heading while following a path (e.g., to aim at a target while driving). Reference PathPlanner documentation on override feedback. Integrate with the drivetrain's applyRequest method. Test in simulation with FollowPathCommand.",Autos
71,Reimplement PID to Point for Climbing Automation,"Create a command that uses PID control to drive the robot to a specific field position (Pose2d) for climbing alignment. This should use the drivetrain's localization (from Vision and gyro) to calculate distance and angle to target. Use WPILib's PIDController or ProfiledPIDController for smooth motion. The command should finish when the robot is within tolerance of the target position.",Automation
72,Calibrate Limelight Cameras,https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/docs-limelight/getting-started/performing-charuco-camera-calibration ,Vision

111,Replace Command Factory with Superstructure (after we know it works),"Once Superstructure is tested and working, refactor RobotContainer to use Superstructure instead of CommandFactory. The Superstructure pattern coordinates subsystems better than CommandFactory by managing state and ensuring subsystems work together safely. Update all command bindings in configureBindings() to use superstructure methods. Remove CommandFactory.java after migration is complete.",Commands
121,Test and Tune Flywheel VelocityTorqueCurrentFOC,"Test the flywheel subsystem using CTRE's VelocityTorqueCurrentFOC control mode on real hardware. Run the flywheel at various RPM setpoints and tune the PID constants (kP, kI, kD) in the motor configuration. Verify velocity control is accurate using Phoenix Tuner X. Log flywheel velocity and error to AdvantageKit. Optimal tuning ensures consistent shooting accuracy.",Testing
131,Cleanup Programming Space,"Organize the programming workspace: remove old test code, unused files, and commented-out sections. Ensure all Java files follow proper formatting (run ./gradlew spotlessApply). Update documentation in AGENTS.md and README.md if needed. Clean up log files in the logs/ directory to free up disk space. Verify all vendor dependencies are up to date.",Administration
134,Implement Mechanical Advantage's Shoot on the move solution in Sim,"Study and implement FRC 6328's shoot-on-the-move algorithm in simulation. This advanced feature allows the robot to shoot accurately while driving by calculating the required lead angle and flywheel velocity based on robot velocity and distance to target. Reference the ShotCalculator approach from Mechanical Advantage's 2026 code. Test thoroughly in sim before deploying to real hardware.",Automation
133,Create an intake pivot command and test it using Simulation,"Create a command that controls the IntakePivot subsystem to move between stowed and deployed positions. Use the IntakePivotIOSim implementation for testing. The command should set a target angle (e.g., 0° for stowed, 90° for deployed) and use the pivot's feedback control to reach the setpoint. Add IntakePivotVisualizer to show pivot angle in simulation GUI.",Simulations

Test that autos correctly coordinate drivetrain, intake pivot, turret, and shooter subsystems together. Use PathPlanner's command markers to trigger subsystem actions at specific path points.",Simulations
185,Test Shoot on The Move,"Test the shoot-on-the-move functionality on real hardware on a full field. Drive the robot at various speeds and angles while attempting to shoot into the hub. Verify that the ShotCalculator correctly compensates for robot velocity. Use AdvantageKit logging to analyze shot accuracy, flywheel RPM, hood angle, and turret angle. Tune parameters as needed for consistent scoring.",Testing
186,Testing Shoot to Arbitrary Point Concept,"Create a proof-of-concept command that shoots to an arbitrary field position (not just the hub). This requires calculating the trajectory based on target position, robot position, and distance. Implement trajectory math for projectile motion considering flywheel RPM and hood angle. Test in simulation first to validate calculations before trying on real hardware.",Simulations
189,Create Shot Calculator class,"Create a shot calculator class with method calls for calculating flywheel rpm, hood angle, and turret angle based on robot position (relative to the hub) and velocity using interpolating tree maps like [6328 does](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/RobotCode2026Public/blob/main/src/main/java/org/littletonrobotics/frc2026/subsystems/shooter/ShotCalculator.java)",Automation
