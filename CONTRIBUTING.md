# Contributing to RainMaker26

Thank you for your interest in our project! However, this repository is maintained by [**FRC Team 360 "The Revolution"**](https://www.frc360.com/) at Bellarmine Prep in Tacoma, WA, and is **not accepting outside contributions**.

## Why is this repo public?

We keep our code public to share with the FIRST Robotics Competition community as part of our [Open Alliance](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/frc-360-the-revolution-2026-build-thread-open-alliance/510290). We're happy for other teams to reference our work for inspiration or learning purposes.

## Can I contribute?

**No.** This codebase is developed exclusively by our team's student members and mentors as part of the FRC build season. Outside pull requests and issue assignments will not be accepted.

If you are a current member of Team 360, please coordinate contributions through our team's internal channels.

## What if I have a question?

If you're an FRC team with a question about our code or approach, feel free to ask us on our [Open Alliance thread](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/frc-360-the-revolution-2026-build-thread-open-alliance/510290). We're happy to help other teams learn.

## ⚠️ Note to drive-by contributors

Unsolicited requests to be assigned to issues (e.g., "Can you assign this to me?") will be closed without response. These issues are internal tasks tracked by our student team, not open-source bounties.
