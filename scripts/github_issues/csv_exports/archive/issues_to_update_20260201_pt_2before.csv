number,title,body,milestone
176,Merge vision simulation branch,Merge the vision sim branch into main; check for PhotonSim Java LSP issues.,Week 3
79,Create test commands for aligning to target,Test commands for vision-based alignment to targets.,Week 3
196,X Out Command for Drivetrain,,Week 3
58,Implement Hopper Sensors for Fuel Level in Robot Code,,Week 3
137,Make Position Commands run until within tolerance,"Currently, setPositionCmd uses runEnd with the same action for both run and end phases. This means the command runs indefinitely until interrupted, and the end action is redundant (it just re-commands the same position).  The command should instead run until the position is within tolerance of the setpoint, then end itself.  For the inputs we should add to the relevant subsystems, follow this pattern:     inputs.setPoint = intakePivot.getClosedLoopReference().getValueAsDouble();     inputs.atSetPoint = TOLERANCE > Math.abs(intakePivot.getClosedLoopReference().getValueAsDouble() - intakePivot.getPosition().getValueAsDouble()); ",Week 3
52,"Replace TalonFX construtors with new, nondeprecated one",,Week 3
195,Take FieldConstants.java from 6328's codebase and implement it in our own,"In order to better understand where the robot is relative to key points of interest, we need a class of field constants containing those points of interest. 6328 currently has such a file in their code base that we can use.  Implement [FieldConstants.java](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/RobotCode2026Public/blob/main/src/main/java/org/littletonrobotics/frc2026/FieldConstants.java) in our codebase and look through it to understand which points of interest it is describing and how it's doing that. Also, we should credit them in the file.",Week 3
89,Set up AprilTags on field,Install AprilTag markers on the practice field for vision testing.,Week 4
51,Conversion Factors Accounting for Gear Ratio,,Week 3
136,Make auto-encoder-zeroing command from Laurens Elevator Code 2025,,Week 3
110,Create a transition plan from Command Factory to Superstructure,,Week 3
62,"Testing Distance, Hood Angle, RPM Speed for Interpolation",,Week 4
85,Implement defense mode,Create a defense mode for robot operation.,Week 4
141,Fix PDH Rev Logging in Advantagekit,,Week 4
102,Implement Command Logger Utility from 2025 Code,,Week 2
187,Add in Onshape CAD Models,,Week 6
188,Create LEDs subsystem,"If we want LEDs on the robot to signal robot state to our drive team, we need to create a subsystem for them while discussing this with Design and Manufacturing.  Use this folder and the classes within from FRC3663 as a reference: https://github.com/team3663/2026-Rebuilt/tree/led/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/led  ALSO CREDIT THEM FOR INSPIRATION",Week 5
190,Using Visual VM to profile the code,,Week 4
191,OPTIONAL Switch over to AdvantageKit Swerve Template for full log replay?,We're probably not doing this but I'm adding this in our back pocket in case we want to switch over to the advantage kit swerve template to unlock log replay,Week 4
203,Tune Heading PID Controller on Swerve,,Week 4
193,Rename Indexer subsystem to Hopper,"Indexer is still one piece of hardware in the hopper, but we want to treat the hopper as the subsystem because we will add various sensors which are unrelated to the Indexer.",Week 4
194,Clean up VisionIOLimelight constructor,"This can probably be cleaned up, ask for details/help if needed.",Week 4
209,Create new April Tag Constants Configuration,"In our Constants file we currently have the AprilTagFieldLayout for 2025Reefscape..., we should get the new layout created and set here.",Week 4
210,Constants Minor Ordering Refactor,"In our Constants file we have constants for the wood bot and simulation, but they aren't all grouped together in a clean way. We should have all the constants for a single subsystem grouped together, with new lines between each grouping.  This is a pretty trivial thing, but if we ever need to look up the constants quickly for debugging, we want everything to be as organized and easy to find as possible.",Week 4
211,Move USB write directories into the Constants file,"In our RobotUtils we have a hardcoded path of ""/U"" for a usb write directory, and this ""/U' is also present in another file in our system. These and any other write directories should be put into our Constants file with a name like ""USB_ROOT_DIRECTORY"" or something similar. That way the multiple references remain in sync, and it is easy for us to find by looking in the constants file.",Week 4
212,More readable log line in CommandSwerveDriveTrain,"For the line `.alongWith(new InstantCommand(() -> System.out.println(""running"")));`, the system print ""running"" probably doesn't mean anything to someone who would read it. This should say something like ""running field oriented drive"" most likely.",Week 4
215,CommandSwerveDriveTrain ensure startSimThread only happens once,"In CommandSwerveDriveTrain we have a function ""startSimThread"" which can be called from 3 of our different constructors. We probably want to add an `if` statement around the body of this function which checks if the m_simNotifier is non-null (already exists), and if it does then we don't need to do anything in the function.  Generally, things which ""start a thread"" (though I don't know how this Notifier class works to understand if it actually is a thread) should have guardrails around them to ensure we can't accidentally call that function a bunch of times and create tons of threads.",Week 4
217,Vision minor loop adjustment,"In our Vision.java there is a for loop `for (String key : ios.keySet()) {` which then immediately calls `VisionIO io = ios.get(key);`. Instead, we can use `ios.entries()` (or there should be something quite close to this) which will get the key+value together.  Same thing just below it `for (String key : visionInputs.keySet()) {`  Very minor thing, but should be a slight perf improvement.",Week 4
218,Subsystem Sim Classes Export SIM Tick Rate to Constant,In our subsystem sim classes we have a hardcoded tick rate of `0.02` which is referenced in place like `.update(0.02);`. We should instead have all the SIM classes reference the same constant for SIM_TICK_RATE_S (S standing for seconds because it is meant to be 20ms). Update all our references to this tick rate across all the classes.,Week 4
223,Research Pathplanner Dynamic Pathing,"Is there a way to change the path we're taking during autos based on whether the hopper is full or not? Ideally, if the hopper is full, we'd go right to shooting without attempting to intake more during our middle autos.",Week 4
224,Add Limelight Rewind Logging when Scoring,"Limelight 4 has a capability called Rewind, which will be useful to diagnose problems with our camera pipelines, and vision targeting. We should implement this to run when shooting, or at other critical points during our matches. ",Week 5
