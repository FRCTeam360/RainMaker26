"11","Implement Snap to Hub Auto-Alignment","Create a command that automatically aligns the robot's heading and position to aim at the hub for scoring. This should use the Vision subsystem to detect the hub's position and create a PID control loop (using WPILib's PIDController) to rotate and/or adjust the robot's driving angle. Reference [photon_swerve_pose_testing](https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker26/tree/photon_swerve_pose_testing) and use the drivetrain's FieldCentricFacingAngle swerve request to control movement. The command should finish when the robot is within angular tolerance (┬▒1 degrees) of the hub and properly positioned for a shot. Test in simulation using Mechanism2d to visualize hub position and robot alignment, then validate on a full field with proper AprilTag positioning.","OPEN","https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker26/issues/11","JRTaylord","enhancement","annashimshock","Week 4","2026-01-15T01:35:35Z","2026-02-02T01:32:40Z","","0","Automation","2 High Priority","Todo"

The turret should rotate to aim at the hub/scoring target. Include methods for setting angle setpoints, reading encoder position, and controlling the motor.

"137","Make Position Commands run until within tolerance","Currently, setPositionCmd uses runEnd with the same action for both run and end phases. This means the command runs indefinitely until interrupted, and the end action is redundant (it just re-commands the same position).  The command should instead run until the position is within tolerance of the setpoint, then end itself.  For the inputs we should add to the relevant subsystems, follow this pattern:     inputs.setPoint = intakePivot.getClosedLoopReference().getValueAsDouble();     inputs.atSetPoint = TOLERANCE > Math.abs(intakePivot.getClosedLoopReference().getValueAsDouble() - intakePivot.getPosition().getValueAsDouble()); ","OPEN","https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker26/issues/137","DelgLe","good first issue","JAMobley","Week 3","2026-01-25T02:10:46Z","2026-02-02T02:10:53Z","","System.Object[]","Commands","","In Review"

"207","Robot Container only create one controller","Inside robot container we create a `driverCont` and a `testCont1`, we probably only need to create whichever one is relevant to the program being run. Similarly the button bindings for both of these are configured on each run, but we should probably only configure the controller which is actively being used.  You may need to ask someone for information about how we know when we are wanting to use the regular driver cont vs the test cont, but the goal is to only have 1 object created for a controller and 1 set of matching bindings configured.","OPEN","https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker26/issues/207","irosenbery","good first issue","","","2026-02-01T01:02:46Z","2026-02-01T01:02:46Z","","0","","","Todo"

"210","Constants Minor Ordering Refactor","In our Constants file we have constants for the wood bot and simulation, but they aren't all grouped together in a clean way. We should have all the constants for a single subsystem grouped together, with new lines between each grouping.  This is a pretty trivial thing, but if we ever need to look up the constants quickly for debugging, we want everything to be as organized and easy to find as possible.","OPEN","https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker26/issues/210","irosenbery","good first issue","","","2026-02-01T01:09:14Z","2026-02-01T01:09:14Z","","0","","","Todo"
"211","Move USB write directories into the Constants file","In our RobotUtils we have a hardcoded path of ""/U"" for a usb write directory, and this ""/U' is also present in another file in our system. These and any other write directories should be put into our Constants file with a name like ""USB_ROOT_DIRECTORY"" or something similar. That way the multiple references remain in sync, and it is easy for us to find by looking in the constants file.","OPEN","https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker26/issues/211","irosenbery","good first issue","","","2026-02-01T01:14:43Z","2026-02-01T01:14:43Z","","0","","","Todo"
"212","More readable log line in CommandSwerveDriveTrain","For the line `.alongWith(new InstantCommand(() -> System.out.println(""running"")));`, the system print ""running"" probably doesn't mean anything to someone who would read it.

"215","CommandSwerveDriveTrain ensure startSimThread only happens once","In CommandSwerveDriveTrain we have a function ""startSimThread"" which can be called from 3 of our different constructors. We probably want to add an `if` statement around the body of this function which checks if the m_simNotifier is non-null (already exists), and if it does then we don't need to do anything in the function.  Generally, things which ""start a thread"" (though I don't know how this Notifier class works to understand if it actually is a thread) should have guardrails around them to ensure we can't accidentally call that function a bunch of times and create tons of threads.","OPEN","https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker26/issues/215","irosenbery","good first issue","Hunter-A-T","","2026-02-01T01:24:27Z","2026-02-01T03:48:39Z","","0","","","Todo"
"217","Vision minor loop adjustment","In our Vision.java there is a for loop `for (String key : ios.keySet()) {` which then immediately calls `VisionIO io = ios.get(key);`. Instead, we can use `ios.entries()` (or there should be something quite close to this) which will get the key+value together.  Same thing just below it `for (String key : visionInputs.keySet()) {`  Very minor thing, but should be a slight perf improvement.","OPEN","https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker26/issues/217","irosenbery","good first issue","","","2026-02-01T01:36:59Z","2026-02-01T12:46:53Z","","System.Object[]","","","Todo"
"218","Subsystem Sim Classes Export SIM Tick Rate to Constant","In our subsystem sim classes we have a hardcoded tick rate of `0.02` which is referenced in place like `.update(0.02);`. We should instead have all the SIM classes reference the same constant for SIM_TICK_RATE_S (S standing for seconds because it is meant to be 20ms). Update all our references to this tick rate across all the classes.","OPEN","https://github.com/FRCTeam360/RainMaker26/issues/218","irosenbery","good first issue","","","2026-02-01T01:42:59Z","2026-02-01T01:42:59Z","","0","","","Todo"
